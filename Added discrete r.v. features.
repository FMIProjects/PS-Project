# Description
Made using R and afferent packages. (Shiny, pracma, animate, rgl)

This project contains a library that supports diverse probability computations for bidimensional discrete random variables and a library + user interface that supports computations and 
graph plotting of unidimensional/bidimensional continuous random variables.

# Features

### Discrete random variables

- [X] Function that generates an incomplete table that represents the joint distribution of 2 discrete random variables.
- [X] Function that completes the incomplete joint distribution.
- [X] Function that extracts the marginal distribution of the 2 variables based on the joint distribution.
- [X] Function that computes the mean, variance and covariance of a random variable based on a joint distribution that contains it.
- [X] Function that computes a probability of a random variable conditioned by another based on their joint distribution.
- [X] Function that computes a probability of 2 random variables based on their joint distribution. 

### Continuous random variables and interface

- [X] Parsing of a function given as input in the app.
- [X] Verification if the Fubinn
